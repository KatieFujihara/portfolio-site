pdxFLIT was created in April 2018, when a fellow code school classmate and I realized that there was a missing meetup in the Portland tech scene. There were a lot of language-specific meetups, there was even a Junior Developer Meetup, but what about the people who aren't sure WHAT they want to do yet...maybe it's design, maybe it's QA, maybe it's PM, etc. I was definitely in the boat of not knowing what I wanted to be in tech, I just knew I wanted to be there. 

pdxFLIT was born out of the need for a place where techies new to the scene could learn and blossom. We like to keep our talks light and fun, we really want to gear it toward people who don't have much technical depth yet. We also focus on non-technical topics such as diversity and inclusion, toxic work environments, what to expect in your first developer role, and being a career changer. I curate the talks every month, and every month there is a theme that all 2-3 talks encompass. We have also hosted a workshop with Intel for resume and cover letter building, as well as, two hackathons.
