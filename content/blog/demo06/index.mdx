# The What
The first thing I address when desiging is WHAT the project is. I either am given a problem that needs to be solved, or I come up with my own. 

# The Who
The next question I address when desiging is WHO I am designing for. I determine who would primarily be using this product or feature.

# The Why
Next, I find out WHY this product or feature needs to be made by doing user research. I figure out the current pain points for potential users by doing user surveys and interviews. After gathering the qualatative data, I make a spreadsheet with notable quotes from the users to find patterns and trends between participants.

# The How
The next step is to think about HOW these pain points can be solved by the product I am building.

# Wireframing and Mockups
After deciding HOW I am going to solve the problem, I create sketches or wireframes to determine a user flow. This is usually done in Figma, Sketch, or Marvel.

# MVP Version 1 and User Testing
After coming up with a mockup I will build a simple static website that goes through the flow of the website wih my designs implemented. I will then send my MVP to some of the participants I interviewed and have them click through it and give feedback.

# Implementation
Using the feedback, I will implement changes into my MVP. I will keep using user testing until I am satisfied with the flow, then I will implement the new designs and functionality.
