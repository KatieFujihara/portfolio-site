# Gatsby
In February 2019, I made my first PR to the Gatsby blog. I submitted a blog that I wrote about how to get started with themes. It covers everything from what you need to install, to using the theme once it is complete. I hope to contribute to Gatsby more by writing more instructional blog posts for people who may just be starting out, and helping to create themes and starters.

# if-me
if-me is a wonderful open-source project that is all about mental health. I was first introduced to if-me in August 2018 at the Write/Speak/Code Conference in NYC. This was the open-source project that I started working on. I am currently helping them organize their styleguide in Storybook so that there is reference guide for common CSS classes used and when each one is used. I hope to continue making contributions for if-me that allow me to assist developers get a better idea of the design direction.
